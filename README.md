## Description
This application is a live collaborative coding editor that allows multiple users to write code at the same time on a program. The user can login and create an account, once they are able to log in they will be directed to their project homepage. The project homepage displays all the user's owned projects and shared projects. When the user selects a project they can invite another user with their username and can begin to collaborate on the project together. In the code editor the user will be able to see their own cursor with their first and last name and designated cursor color,  as well as the other user when present.
